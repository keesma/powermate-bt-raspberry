Powermate BT Raspberry Pi integration with squeezelite

This scripts connects a raspberry pi to the powermate bluetooth.
It supports pause/play by pressing the powermate and volume increase/decrease by turning the powermate knob.
You might also select previous or next song by turning the knob while pressing but this does not work reliable.

The powermate shuts down automatically.

The script uses the LMSTools library to connect to the Logitech Media Server (https://github.com/elParaguayo/LMSTools).
